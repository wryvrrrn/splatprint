placeholder lines/lines that need work are generally commented with #(WIP)

general:
- set up command line switches
- clean up junk files in project folder
- set up demo folder (normal and inverse test images, macro preview, in-game screenshot (first pass), repair macro preview, in-game screenshot (second pass))
- save flag? only takes screenshot image, outputs to a png (for editing a post that you've drawn in-game)

__main__.py:
- proper CLI argument setup
- change default delay for repair print (slow it down maybe)?

printpost.py:
- option to only print bottom pixels if they're in a column you're repairing? (maybe not necessary)
